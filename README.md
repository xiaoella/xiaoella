### Hello there 👋🏼 
**I am Xiao 👩🏻‍💻 and welcome to my GitHub!**

This is my `coding journey` so far...

I am passionate in leveraging my strong problem-solving skills and delivering data-driven solutions to complex problems, from a creative as well as logical approach.

- 🌱 I use Python, but also enjoy solving code challenges in SQL and C.
- 🍳 One of my most recent personal project is to find the ✨[perfect Laura Ashely dresses](https://github.com/xiaoella/find_my_laura_ashley)✨ from Etsy. Check out my other repos too!
- 📐 Fun fact: I trained and worked as an architect.
