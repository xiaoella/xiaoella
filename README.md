### Hello there 👋🏼 
I am Xiao 👩🏻‍💻 Welcome to my GitHub!

This is my coding journey so far as a Data Science student coming from a background in architecture. I made the decision to pursue this career so that I could leverage my analytical skills and creativity to solve complex problems using logical, data-driven approaches. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C and SQL.
- 🍳 I’m also working on some personal projects...
