### Hello there 👋🏼 
**I am Xiao 👩🏻‍💻 and welcome to my GitHub!**

This is my `coding journey` so far as a Data Science student at CoGrammar + HyperionDev.

Coming from a background as an architect, I made the decision to pursue this career so that I could leverage my analytical skills and creativity to solve complex problems using logical, data-driven approaches. 

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, C and SQL
- 🍳 I’m also working on some personal projects    <sub>_keep your eyes peeled_<sub>
- 🙋🏻‍♀️ Please feel free to reach out to me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/xiao-ella-ma/)!
