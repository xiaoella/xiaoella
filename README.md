### Hello there 👋🏼 
**I am Xiao 👩🏻‍💻 and welcome to my GitHub!**

This is my `coding journey` so far...

I am passionate in leveraging my strong problem-solving skills and delivering data-driven solutions to complex problems, from a creative as well as logical approach.

- 🌱 I use Python, but also enjoy solving code challenges in C and SQL.
- 🍳 I’m curently working on [this personal project](https://github.com/xiaoella/find_my_laura_ashley) to find the ✨perfect Laura Ashely dresses✨ from Etsy. Check out my other repos too!
- 📐 Fun fact: I trained and worked as an architect.
