### Hello there 👋🏼 
**I am Xiao 👩🏻‍💻 and welcome to my GitHub!**

- 🔤 I use `Kotlin` and `Python`, but also enjoy solving code challenges in `SQL`.
- 🍳 One of my most recent personal project is to find the ✨[perfect Laura Ashely dresses](https://github.com/xiaoella/find_my_laura_ashley)✨ from Etsy. Check out my other repos too!
- 📐 Fun fact: I trained and worked as an architect.
