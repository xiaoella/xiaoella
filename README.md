### Hello there 👋🏼 
**I am Xiao 👩🏻‍💻 and welcome to my GitHub!**

This is my `coding journey` so far...

I am passionate in leveraging my strong problem-solving skills and delivering data-driven solutions to complex problems, from a creative as well as logical approach.

- 🌱 I use Python, but also enjoy solving code challenges in C and SQL.
- 🍳 I’m curently working on some personal projects such as this one: [Finding my Laura Ashely](https://github.com/xiaoella/find_my_laura_ashley)  <sub>_and check out my other repos!_<sub>
- 📐 Fun fact: I have a background... as an architect!
